# Build Dependencies

This project depends on multiple libs and header files for the engine to run the application successfully. For convenience, the libs and include header files are already a part of the repo. Below is a list of DLLs and libs that are required:

* SDL2.0.14 - http://libsdl.org/download-2.0.php
* SDL2_image-2.0.5 - https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/ (Image loading library)
* SDL2_ttf-2.0.15 - https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/ (True Type Font library)
